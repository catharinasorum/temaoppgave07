This is a bookcase App for iOS/Android that connects to firebase/firestore with a fetch call to the build-in REST API.

It uses the <a href='http://svelte-native.technology/docs'>svelte-native</a> framework to build a native application. Svelte-Native is build on top of <a href='http://nativescript.org'>Nativescript</a>, so you need to go through the setup guide there in order to install the TNS CLI tools

## Set up
```html
npm install
tns run [ios|android]
```
